	  </h1>
	  <h2>
	  	Thanks for offering to help me out with this project! You will be shown 60 charts/graphs, and for each chart/graph you will be asked to compare the sizes of two data points in the graph. The data points are either marked with an asterisk (*) or they are colored in with the color grey (The page will tell you which to look for).
	  </h2>
	  <h2>
	  	Please complete all 60 trials (I can't use the data otherwise), and once you're done you'll be brought to a screen that tells you how you did!
